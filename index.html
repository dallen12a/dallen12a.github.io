Once logged in and verified through a user database, the user can add, remove, or reset the course database. If logged in as an administrator, user accounts can be added and deleted.

            This C++ code takes an input text file and encrypts the data by the given XOR-Encryption key and outputs an encrypted and decrypted text file. The encrypted file contains the input text file in a security-safe format with a name and timestamp at the top. The decrypted shows what the input data file was with the same name and timestamp at the top.

            This C++ code takes an input text file and encrypts the data by the given AES-Encryption key and outputs an encrypted and decrypted text file. This program builds upon the base XOR encryption activity. The encrypted file contains the input text file in a security-safe format with a name and timestamp at the top. The decrypted shows what the input data file was with the same name and timestamp at the top.

        <div class="project-details">
          <div class="languages">
            <span class="bubble">C++</span>
            <span class="bubble">OpenGL</span>
          </div>
          <p>
          The project sets up an OpenGL environment, loads and renders a 3D scene with lighting, textures, and user interaction for navigating the scene and adjusting lighting properties. The main focus is on graphics rendering and interactive visualization using
          modern graphics techniques.</p>
          <h3>OpenGL Setup and Initialization:</h3>
          <p>The project uses OpenGL for rendering, and it starts by setting up OpenGL context using GLFW and GLEW libraries.
          It configures window dimensions, title, and sets up input callbacks.</p>
          <h3>Shader Programs:</h3>
          <p>The project defines vertex and fragment shader source codes, compiles them, and links them into shader programs.
          These shaders handle rendering operations, including lighting and texture mapping.</p>
          <h3>Mesh and Texture Loading:</h3>
          <p>The project defines structures and functions for loading meshes and textures.
          Textures are loaded from image files using the stb_image library.</p>
          <h3>Scene and Light Setup:</h3>
          <p>The project defines structures to hold information about the scene, meshes, lights, and cameras.
          Light properties (e.g., color, position) are initialized, including a spotlight and a key light.</p>
          <h3>Rendering and Input Handling:</h3>
          <p>The project implements functions for rendering the scene and processing user input.
          It uses camera controls for navigation (WASD, mouse) and allows changing the view mode (perspective/ortho).
          Lighting properties can be modified interactively via keyboard input (e.g., light position, color).</p>
          <h3>Main Loop:</h3>
          <p>The project enters a main loop where it processes input, updates the scene, and renders it.</p>
          <h3>Light Visualization:</h3>
          <p>The project includes visualization of the lights using simple geometric shapes (light cubes).</p>
          <h3>Texture Mapping:</h3>
          <p>Texture coordinates are used to map textures onto the meshes in the scene.</p>
